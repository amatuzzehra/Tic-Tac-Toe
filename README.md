# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction
First game that I have made - TicTacToe. I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This is how it looks!

## Method 
This is a two-player game. The game starts with Player X. 

Both Player X and Player O place their marks alternatively in the empty spaces of the 3x3 square grid. The player who successfully places its mark vertically, horizontally or diagonally wins the game. 

If no player reaches the above case and all the empty spaces are filled, the game ends in a draw.
